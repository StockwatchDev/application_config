- Protocol classes so that we can use structural typing for function parameters and return types:
  ParameterContainerProtocol, ParameterContainerSectionProtocol, UpdateableParameterContainerProtocol;
- Configuration - and settings parameters for the package `application_settings` itself, namely the
  import string for the Config class / the Settings class that the application uses and whether or not
  to use `application_settings` in strict mode.

## [0.3.0] - 2023-06-21

### Added - 0.3.0

- Multiple versions of documentation served on Github Pages.
- You can now request a (re-) load when setting the filepath or via a method `load`.
- You can choose whether or not to throw a `FileNotFoundError` during `load`
  when the parameter file is not found in the expected location
  (Issue [#51](https://github.com/StockwatchDev/application_settings/issues/51))
- Support for parameters in the main container (Issue
  [#20](https://github.com/StockwatchDev/application_settings/issues/20)).
- Support for subsections (arbitrary depth) (Issue
  [#5](https://github.com/StockwatchDev/application_settings/issues/5)).
- Sections also stored as a singleton, so that libs can define and access parameters
  via their own Section (Issue 
  [#46](https://github.com/StockwatchDev/application_settings/issues/46)).
- Literal SectionTypeStr exported.
- Convenience functions to specify filepath for config and settings via command-line

  Settings.
